## Customization

### Adding Songs

To add new songs, update the `src/data/lyricsData.js` file using this structure:

```javascript
{
  id: 6,
  title: "Song Title",
  artist: "Artist Name",
  album: "Album Name",
  lyrics: "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3",
  year: 2023,
  genre: "Genre",
  coverArt: "https://link-to-image.jpg",
  duration: "3:45"
}
```

### Styling

* Component-specific styles are located alongside components in their respective folders.
* Global styles reside in `src/App.css` and `src/index.css`.
* Dark mode styling uses the `.dark` class selector. Example:

```css
/* Light mode */
.lyric-card {
  background-color: #fff;
}

/* Dark mode */
.dark .lyric-card {
  background-color: #1f2937;
}
```
